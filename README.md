    > git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/eapi-airtable-akveo-seed.git  project-xyz (project-xyz = The name of your project/folder)
    


## Connecting to Effortless API

Enter into your folder: The name of your project/folder from above

    > cd project-xyz

To connect your new repository to your effortless API Endpoint, run these commands:

    > npm install
    
*Your Project URL is in Effortless API: Insert "ej-tictactoe-demo" (Ex. amqps://smqPublic:smqPublic@/ej-tictactoe-demo)*

    > ssotme -init -name=ejtictactoedemo -addSetting amqps=amqps://smqPublic:smqPublic@effortlessapi-rmq.ssot.me/ej-tictactoe-demo -addSetting dataclasses-namespace=ejtictactoedemo.Lib.DataClasses

    > ssotme -build

The code will start to build in the background, and VSCode will open in the root of the project. 
Use the following instructions to tailor the example for your project.


    1. Start VS Code.  On Windows that command is 'code .'.  
    2. Open the `src/app/app-modules.ts` lines 70 to configure your EAPI Endpoint
    2A. Grab YOUR-PROJECT-NAME from the URL in Effortless API (Ex. amqps://smqPublic:smqPublic@effortlessapi-rmq-ssot.me/ej-tictactoe-demo)
    2B. Maybe fix Roles configuration.
    1. Be sure that angular CLI is installed: 
    2. From the command line, once the `npm install` and `ssotme -build` have completed, run `ng serve`
    3. Open http://localhost:4200 in a browser
    

This will create a local typescript sdk for your EffortlesAPI endpoint - allowing you to immediately begin writing code:

    guest = SMQGuest("amqps://effortlessapi-rmq.ssot.me/you-project-xyz")

    payload = StandardPayload()
    payload.EmailAddress = "you@domain.com"
    payload.DemoPassword = "123"

    guest.ValidateTemporaryAccessToken(payload)
